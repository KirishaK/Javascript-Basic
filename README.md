JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development to create interactive and dynamic content. It enables developers to build responsive web applications, enhance user experiences, and automate tasks. It covers basic concepts with examples to demonstrate how to use JavaScript effectively.

1.	Printing to Console:

Code Example: 

console.log ("Hello, My name is kirisa!");

•	What I Learned: Used `console.log () ` to output messages.
•	What I Did:  Printed a message with my name using `console.log ("Hello, My name is Kirisa!"); `.

2.	Variables and Constants:

Code Example:

let age = 23;
const PI = 3.14;

•	What I Learned: Declared variables (`let`) and constants (`const`).
•	What I Did: Set `age = 23;` and `const PI = 3.14;` to understand variable mutability and constant immutability.

3.	Arrays:

Code Example:

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]);

•	What I Learned: Created arrays to store multiple values.
•	What I Did: Printed the first element of the `colors` array (`console.log(colors[0]);`).


4.	Conditional Statements:

Code Example:

let num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("Number is negative");
}

•	What I Learned: Used `if...else` to execute code based on conditions.
•	What I Did: Checked if `num > 0` and printed whether the number is positive or negative

5.	Loops:
Code Example:
// For Loop
console.log("For Loop:");
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// While Loop
console.log("\nWhile Loop:");
let j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
    console.log(j);
    j++;
}

•	What I Learned: Implemented `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks.
•	What I Did: Used a `for` loop to write numbers to the document and a `while` loop to log numbers to the console.

6.	Functions:

Code Example:
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("John"));
•	What I Learned: Defined functions to perform specific tasks.
•	What I Did: Created a `greet` function that returns a personalized greeting (`console.log(greet("John"));`).

7.	Objects:

Code Example:

let person = {
    firstName: "kirisha",
    lastName: "navam",
    age: 23,
    fullName: function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
};
console.log(person.fullName());  

•	What I Learned: Constructed objects with properties and methods.
•	What I Did: Defined a `person` object with `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and a `fullName` method (`console.log(person.fullName());`).

8.	Handling User Input:	

Code Example:

let userInput = prompt("Enter your name:");
console.log("Hello, " + userInput);

•	What I Learned: Captured user input and interacted with it.
•	What I Did: Used `prompt` to get user input for their name and displayed a greeting (`console.log("Hello, " + userInput);`).

9. Arithmetic Operations:

Code Example:

let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log("Sum:", sum);

let subtraction = num1 - num2;
console.log("Subtraction:", subtraction);

let multiplication = num1 * num2;
console.log("Multiplication:", multiplication);

let division = num1 / num2;
console.log("Division:", division);

•	What I Learned: Performed basic arithmetic operations using JavaScript.
•	What I Did: Calculated the sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers (num1 and num2) and printed the results.


These exercises taught me a foundational understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, arrays, control flow, loops, functions, objects, and user interaction. 
Each example helped me grasp essential programming concepts and improve my ability to solve problems using JavaScript. I look forward to further exploring advanced topics and applying
 my knowledge to real-world projects.
